# JPG to PDF Conversion

Taken originally from this [Github repository](https://github.com/praneetk2704/JPG-to-PDF), run `convert.py` to convert the images in the `jpgs` folder __each__ into a PDF file, located in `pdfs` folder. 

#### To-do:
- [ ] Ability to maintain a PDF file in landscape mode if the image has a width larger than height (still pending due to bugs while implementation).
- [ ] Save an exe file to run the script automatically, such that Python dependencies need not be installed on new PCs.
